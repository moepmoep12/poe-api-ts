## Introduction

The purpose of this library to provide simple access to the different APIs of the game [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) by Grinding Gear Games. The library was built upon the previous work of [klayveR](https://github.com/klayveR) and his library [poe-api-wrappers](https://github.com/klayveR/poe-api-wrappers). Unfortunately, poe-api-wrappers is no longer maintained, outdated, and doesn't provide access to the OAuth2 API. Hence, this library was created.
